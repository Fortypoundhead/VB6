VB6 Tutorial 42: The Combobox

<p>In this lesson, I'll tell you about the ComboBox control in brief. </p>
<p>ComboBox is the combination of a TextBox and a ListBox. The user can type in the text field to select an item or select an item manually from the list. All the properties, events and methods of a ComboBox control are as same as the ListBox control. So the discussion of ListBox control in previous lessons  also applies for ComboBox control.</p>
<h3>Styles of ComboBox</h3>
<p>There are three styles of ComboBox controls-- Dropdown Combo, Simple Combo and Dropdown List. You can change/select the style from the Style property of ComboBox.</p>

Private Sub Form_Load()
    For i = 1980 To 2012
        cboBirthYear.AddItem Str(i)   'Str function returns the 
                             'string representation of a number
        i = Val(i)
    Next i
End Sub</pre></p>
