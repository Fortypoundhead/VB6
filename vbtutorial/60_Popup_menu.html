VB6 Tutorial 60: Popup menu

<p>Most commercial software products have popup menus (also known as context menus) as they can make the application more user-friendly and powerful.</p>

<p>When you right click on windows desktop, a popup menu appears. Visual Basic 6.0 provides a Popup menu method that you can use in your program to show the popup menu on the form's surface.</p>
<p>To use the Popup menu method, you first need to create a menu. For example, create a menu with the name "View". See the example given below.</p>

<h3>The PopupMenu method</h3>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><pre>PopupMenu Menu, [Flags], [X], [Y], [DefaultMenu] </pre></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Arguments in [ ] brackets are optional.</p>
<p>Now write the following code in the form's MouseDown event to invoke the popup menu.</p>
<p><pre>Private Sub Form_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single)
    If Button = vbRightButton Then
        PopupMenu mnuView   'PopupMenu is a method
    End If
End Sub</pre></p>

<p>If you need only the popup menu but not the menu bar, set the Visible property of the menu control to False in design time.</p>
