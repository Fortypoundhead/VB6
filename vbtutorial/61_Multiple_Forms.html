VB6 Tutorial 61: Multiple Forms

<p>In Visual Basic 6, a windows application may have more than one window. Most of the windows applications contain several windows. You can make a multiple windows software by adding some forms to your project as because forms are nothing but the windows of the final product.</p>

<h3>Adding a form to your existing project</h3>
<p>To add a form, go to Project >Add Form from the menu bar of the IDE. A window will appear to choose a form template.</p>

<p>You may change the Name property of the added form for your advantage. Remember, the forms are considered as objects.</p>
<h3>Showing a form</h3>
<p>You can show the newly added form using the Show method.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><pre>Form.Show [Modal], [Owner form]</pre></p>
<p><b>[Modal]</b> means whether the form is modal or not. A modal form forces you to stay on the form until you close it or enter some data. You may have noticed this kind of form in several windows programs.</p>
<p><b>[Owner form]</b> constant determines which form to be set as the owner form.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>You can make a form visible using any one of the following:</p>
<ul><li><pre>Form2.Show</pre></li>
<li><pre>Form2.Show vbModal</pre></li>
<li><pre>Form2.Show vbModeless</pre></li>
<li><pre>Form2.Show vbModal, Form1</pre></li></ul>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p><pre>'in Form1 
Private Sub cmdShowForm2_Click()
    Form2.Show vbModal
End Sub
'in Form1 
Private Sub cmdShowForm2_Click()
    Form2.Show
    Unload Me   'unloads the current form
End Sub</pre></p>
<h3>Unloading a form</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/S7oZb66.jpg" alt="Choose a form template" title="Choose a form template" /></p> 
<p><pre>'in Form1 
Private Sub cmdUnloadForm2_Click()
    Unload Form2
End Sub</pre></p>
<p>You can also use the Hide method.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><pre>Form2.Hide</pre></p>
<p>When you unload a form, it releases the memory which was allocated for the form. But the Hide method only hides the form, it doesn't unload it from the memory.</p>
<h3>Controlling a form from another form</h3>
<p>You can change the properties of another form.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><pre>'in Form1
Private Sub Command1_Click()
    Form2.BackColor = vbBlue
End Sub </pre></p>
<p>You can even set the controls' properties which are on another form.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><pre>'in Form1 
Form2.Text1.Text = "Welcome!"</pre></p>
<p>In the next lesson, you'll learn about the splash screen which is a special form template. </p>
