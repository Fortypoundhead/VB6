<p>You can use splash-screen in your windows app to make the program more attractive. The splash screen is a form template which you should set to appear before the main window or the actual program appears.</p>

<p>This screen only stays for some second showing the company name, logo, product name, product version, copyright information and some other information.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This is an example splash screen created using the template that comes with VB6.</p>

<h3>How to make a splash screen</h3>
<p>You can choose from the default template. Go to Project >Add Form from the menu bar and select splash screen. Then modify the form as per your needs. </p>
<p>The other way is, add a form to your existing project. Set the BorderStyle property to None. Then edit the form according to your choice.</p>
<h3>Working with the splash screen</h3>
<p>Take a timer on the splash screen form. Set the interval to some seconds, for example 3 seconds. Then you need to set the Timer's Interval property to 3000. </p>
<p>Write the following code in the Timer's Timer Event. Suppose the form you want to load after the splash screen is frmMain.</p>
<p><pre>Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
    Timer1.Enabled = False
    frmMain.Show
    Unload Me
End Sub</pre></p>
<p>On executing the code, the splash screen stays for 3 seconds and then the Main Window is shown after the splash form is unloaded.</p>
