VB6 Tutorial 59: Menus

<p>Menus are one of the most important features of a software product. Every standard software must have menus. You generally see a menu on top of a software interface.</p>

<p>Menus are controls but different from the controls in the ToolBox and they don't work like the other controls. You can drop a menu on the form from the Menu Editor Window. Press Ctrl+E to show the Menu Editor Window or right-click on the form and click Menu Editor. The Menu Editor Window can also be shown from the Menu Editor icon of the ToolBar.</p>
<h3>Building a menu</h3>
<p>Building a menu is very simple, you can do it on your own. Simply fill the Caption and Name field in the Menu Editor Window and click ok to create it. </p>

<h3>Properties of the menu items</h3>
<p>The important properties of the menu items are Name, Caption, Checked, Enabled, Shortcut and Visible. As per your programming need, set the properties either in run-time or in design time. You can create a shortcut key for a menu item. In some situations you may want to disable a menu item, you can acquire it through the Enabled property. </p>
<p>The menu control exposes only one event, the Click event. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Make a menu as same as the following image.</p>

<p>Now write the following code.</p>
<p><pre>Private Sub mnuBlue_Click()
    Form1.BackColor = vbBlue 'Makes the Form blue
End Sub

Private Sub mnuGreen_Click()
    Form1.BackColor = vbGreen 'Makes the form green
End Sub

Private Sub mnuRed_Click()
    Form1.BackColor = vbRed  'Makes the form red
End Sub

Private Sub mnuWhite_Click()
    Form1.BackColor = vbWhite  'Makes the form white
End Sub</pre></p>
<p>Now run the program and Click on the menu items and see what happens.</p>
<h3>The Checked property</h3>
<p>Design a form like the output image of the following program. Create a Help menu and drop a Label control on the form with the caption 'Help'.</p>

<p><pre>Private Sub mnuShowHelp_Click()
    If mnuShowHelp.Checked = True Then
        mnuShowHelp.Checked = False
        Label2.Visible = False
    ElseIf mnuShowHelp.Checked = False Then
