VB6 Tutorial 50: Arrays

<p>An array is a collection of items of the same data type. All items have the same name and they are identified by a subscript or index. When you need to work with several similar data values, you can use array to eliminate the difficulties of declaring  so many variables. </p>

<p>For example, if you want to compute the daily sales and sum the sales amount after 30 days, you don't need to have 30 variables. Just simply declare an array of size 30 and get your work done !</p>
<h3>Declaring an array</h3>
<p>Syntax: Dim Variable_Name(index) As [Type]</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><pre>Dim month(10) As Integer   '11 elements</pre></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><pre>Dim month(1 to 12) as Integer   '12 elements</pre></p>
<p>In the first line, month(10) is a collection of 11 integer values or items. month(0) is the 1st item and month(10) is the 10th & last item of the array. So 0 and 10 are respectively the lower bound and upper bound of the array.</p>
<p>In the other line, month(1 to 12) is a collection of 12 integer values or elements or items where month(1) is the 1st item and month(12) is the last. So 1 and 12 are respectively the lower bound and upper bound of the array.</p>
<h3>Types of arrays</h3>
<p>The array used in the example is a one-dimensional and fixed-size array. An array can have more than one dimension. The other types of arrays are multi-dimensional arrays, Dynamic arrays and Control arrays. </p>
<p>Fixed-Size Array: We know the total number of items the array in the above example holds. So that is a Fixed-Size array.</p>
<h3>LBound and UBound</h3>
<p>The LBound and Ubound functions return the lower bound and upper bound of an array respectively.</p>
<h4>Example</h4> 
<p><pre>Private Sub cmdDisplay_Click()
    Dim arr(10) As Integer
    a = LBound(arr)
    b = UBound(arr)
    MsgBox "Lower bound = " & a & "  Upper bound = " & b
End Sub</pre></p>
<h3>Initializing an array</h3>
<p>You can use For Loop to initialize an array.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><pre>Dim day(10) As Integer, i As Integer
For i = 0 To 10
     day(i) = InputBox("Enter day value")
Next i</pre></p>
<p>You can also initialize each array item separately in the way a variable is initialized. </p>
<h4>Example</h4> 
<p>This program inputs the Sale amount of each day and sums the total amount of 5 days.</p>
<p><pre>Private Sub cmdStart_Click()
    Dim SaleDay(1 To 5)      'Sale in a particular day
    Dim i As Integer, Sale As Long
    Sale = 0
    For i = 1 To 5
        SaleDay(i) = InputBox("Enter Sale amount of Day " & i)
        Sale = Sale + SaleDay(i)
    Next i
    MsgBox "Total Sale of 5 days = $" & Sale
End Sub</pre></p>
