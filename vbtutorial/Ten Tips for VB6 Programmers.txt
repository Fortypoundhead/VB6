<p>Programmers follow a number of informal coding rules to improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of their code. This post will teach you how to write better code in Visual Basic.</p>

<h3>Write comments for others and yourself.</h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, comments make your program more understandable. Your comments will not just help other programmers understand your code, they will also be helpful for you.</p>
<h4>Here are some tips</h4>
<ul><li>Write comments as you are writing the code. If you want to write the comments after finishing your entire project or even after finishing a small part of the project, that is a bad idea. Because at that time, you will forget where you had to write the comments.</li>
<li>Write comments clearly. Your comments should be concise and easy to understand.</li>
<li>Write comments at the beginning of every module, function or block of code. Describe what it does, or give any other necessary information.</li>
<li>Write comments in the places where confusion may arise. Clear the confusions using some appropriate comments.</li></ul>

<h3>Variable Naming</h3>
<p>Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Naming meaningfully the variables, symbolic constants, controls, modules, and functions will greatly increase the readability of your code.</p>
<h4>Naming variables</h4>
<p>Give meaningful names to the variables. This will help you understand which variable is used for what purpose. For example, 'number', 'sum', 'result', and 'average' are the meaningful variable names.</p>
<h4>Naming Functions</h4>
<p>When you are writing a user-defined function, give a meaningful name to it so that one can understand from the name what the function does. Example: GetResult().</p>
<h4>Naming controls</h4>
<p>For VB6 programs, generally, three-letter prefixes are added to the control names. The three-letter prefix indicates which control you are using. And the remaining part of the control name describes the action performed by the control.</p>
<p>For example, <b>cmdShow</b> is a control name, where <b>cmd</b> indicates that this is a command button and <b>Show</b> tells that it shows something. There are no fixed rules for this. You may have your own style. Learn more about naming conventions.</p>
<h4>Named constants and modules</h4>
<p>Names of symbolic constants and modules should also be meaningful.</p>

<h3>Format your code.</h3>
<p>Formatted code is easy to read. Use indentation in your code. Give tabs and spaces wherever necessary.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><pre>If n1 = 0 Then
    result1 = "0"
Else
    Do While n1 >= 1
        r1 = mod_operator(n1, 2)
        result1 = r1 & result1
        n1 = Fix(n1 / 2)
    Loop
End If</pre></p>

<h3>Scoping</h3>
<p>Smaller Scope and shorter lifetime are better. To avoid confusions, make the scope of a variable as small as possible. The lifetime should also be very short. This will ensure maintainability. I know that sometimes, a small scope and short lifetime are difficult to achieve but you should definitely have small scopes and short lifetime when possible.</p>

<h3>Choose the right data types</h3>
<p>Consider taking small-sized datatypes wherever possible. The variables, that are too large, waste memory space.</p>

<h3>Eliminate unnecessary variables</h3>
<p>Whenever you are using unnecessary variables, you are wasting memory space, and it will make the program very large in size. Taking a small number of variables greatly optimizes the code.</p>

<h3>Error handling is a must</h3>
<p>Error handling is a must for any project. Error handling ensures that the code will not suddenly stop running despite the fact that there is an error or exception in the program.</p>
<p>For example, in a calculator program, if the user enters a 100 digit number, a message should be displayed informing the user that the number is too large. </p>
<p>And suppose you</b>re dividing a number by 0. This will cause a run-time error and the program will stop. So you have to develop efficient routines that can handle the exception and show the user an error message.</p>

<h3>Use <b>Option Explicit</b></h3>
<p>In Visual Basic, use the <b>Option Explicit</b> statement to ensure that all the variables are explicitly declared. </p>

<h3>Avoid control flow functions</h3>
<p>Avoid control flow functions as they are slow. The control flow functions let you write less code, but they are slow. So use control flow statements instead.</p>
<h4>Related Items</h4>

If-Else statements
Select Case statement

<h3>Keep the code simple</h3>
<p>The best advice I can give you is - keep the code simple. Always try to find a simple solution to any problem.</p>

<p>These are the common programming practices that will improve the quality of your code. These coding principles will help you develop readable, maintainable, and high-performing programs.</p>
