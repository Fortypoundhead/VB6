<p>Visual Basic, derived from the Basic language, is an object based and even-driven programming language from Microsoft. This language is relatively easy to learn.</p>
<p>It enables you to create GUI (graphical user interface) applications easily using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) technique.The one most interesting feature of this language is , it comes with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The easy-to-use tools of the IDE enable you to create buttons, textbox, and other controls for your applications with minimum efforts. </p>
<h3>History of Visual Basic</h3>
<p>We are not exploring the history of VB in depth, but a little knowledge is necessary. Visual Basic 1.0 was released in May, 1991 while Visual Basic 6.0 came out in 1998. The following table represents the versions of Visual Basic according to their release year. </p>
<p><i>Versions of Visual Basic with release year:</i></p>
<table><tbody> <tr> <th>Versions</th> <th>Year of release</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Visual basic 1.0</td> <td>1991</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Visual basic 2.0</td> <td>1992</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Visual basic 3.0</td> <td>1993</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Visual basic 4.0</td> <td>1995</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Visual basic 5.0</td> <td>1997</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Visual basic 6.0</td> <td>1998</td> </tr> </tbody></table> 
<h3>Power of Visual Basic 6.0</h3>
<p>Visual Basic 6.0 is a very powerful programming language. It enables GUI application development, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls. Visual Basic supports API programming that lets you handle the windows.</p>
<p>You can develop simple GUI program, large and complex commercial applications, applications for enterprise solutions and internet based applications.</p>
<h3>How to learn VB effectively</h3>
<p>The main purpose of learning VB is obviously to achieve the ability to develop software programs. So you need to learn almost everything of it. Though this is quite difficult to master the language in its entirety as because Visual Basic is too large to complete, you should keep on exploring different features of the language everyday.</p>
<p>One best way to learn VB is to learn with sample programs. Edit the sample programs how you want and see what happens after that, and you have to try to develop unique but small applications on your own after studying each lesson of this tutorial. You must first study the lessons to have a good concept of the topic before working with the sample programs. You will find many downloadable sample programs with source code in this tutorial.</p>
<p>After reading some lessons, you have to revise the previous lessons on a regular basis so that you can easily remember the use of functions, properties, methods and other features.</p>
