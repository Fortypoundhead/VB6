VB6 Tutorial 38: Formatting Functions

<p>This lesson will explain how to set date and time and how to display current date and time in VB6 code. This lesson does not dive into depth but gives you the basic concept of date and time in Visual Basic 6.</p>

<p>In this lesson we'll cover Date, Time, Now, Timer, and the Date data type.

<h3>Displaying current date and time</h3>
<p>Using Date and Time properties, you can set or display the system's current date and time respectively. The Time property displays both, current date and time.</p>
<div class="info">
<h3>QuickHint:</h3>
<p>Date, Time and Now are not functions, they are properties.</p>
</div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Displays current time</p>
<p><pre>Print Time             '12:53:12 PM</pre></p>
<p>Displays current date</p>
<p><pre>Print Date             '04-09-2012</pre></p>
<p>Displays current date and time</p>
<p><pre>Print Now              '04-09-2012  12:53:12 PM</pre></p>
<h3>Setting the system date and time</h3>
<p>You can set the current date and time of your computer in Visual Basic code.</p>
<h4>Example</h4> 
<p>On clicking the CommandButton, the system date and time are changed.</p>
<p><pre>Private Sub cmdSetDateTime_Click()
    Date = "04-10-2012"
    Time = "02:38:00 PM"
End Sub</pre></p>
<h3>The Timer property</h3>
<p>The Timer property returns the number of seconds elapsed since midnight.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>  
<p><pre>Private Sub cmdShow_Click()
    MsgBox Timer & " seconds elapsed since midnight"
End Sub</pre></p>
<h3>Using the Date data type</h3>
<p><pre>Dim d As Date
d = Now
Print d</pre></p>
<p>Declare a variable as Date, then you can assign any date value to this variable. The date data type lets you work with date-time values most efficiently.</p>
<p>Visual Basic gives you many properties and methods to handle date-time values. As we go through the rest of the lessons in this tutorial, each one will be covered along the way.</p>
